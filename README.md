# Liquid Neural Network (LNN) Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a simple **Liquid Neural Network (LNN)**. LNNs are dynamic neural networks inspired by biological neurons, which update their internal states over time using a combination of input stimuli and their previous state.

This implementation is designed for basic experimentation with the CIFAR-10 dataset, demonstrating how to process image data using a Liquid Neural Network.

## Features
- **Custom Liquid Neural Network (LNN)**:
  - Dynamic hidden state updates based on input and past states.
  - Softmax output for classification tasks.
- **Supports CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
  - Normalization and preprocessing included.
  - Predictions on raw CIFAR-10 data.

## Prerequisites
1. **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher
2. **Dependencies**:
   - `numpy`
   - `tensorflow`
